      LocalChange improves several benchmarks 35% In our last update we described a performance optimization we wanted to make which we suspected would improve our performance by shiftng responsibility for tracking changes from the backend of the library to the frontend. We&rsquo;re pleased to report that the localChange branch has been merged and is showing good results on the benchmarking front.

      Behind Automerge-RS In 2017, Ink &amp; Switch decided to collaborate with Martin Kleppmann to see if we could build an easy to use CRDT in javascript based on Martin&rsquo;s research. By and large, I think we were successful, which can be seen in Automerge v0.14.1.
While we hit the goals of being a correct CRDT that was easy to use, there were a number of shortcomings. It was too slow, and as every change in the history was stored completely in an uncompressed format, the footprint of a document was too large.
